<color=yellow>NOTICE:</color> 
This mod may still have issues due lacking to test it deeply - specially, was lightly tested along other mods, so may have unmapped incompatibilities.

I'll be watching the comments regularly to make small fixes until August/2023.

If you are getting this mod after this date and reading this, so it means the mod is stable already and you may ignore this notice.
